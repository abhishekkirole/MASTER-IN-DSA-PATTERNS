## 📌 About This Repository

**MASTER-IN-DSA-PATTERNS** is a complete execution-focused DSA preparation system organized by **problem-solving patterns**, not random topics.

This repository helps you:

- ✅ Recognize patterns quickly in interviews  
- ✅ Build strong problem-solving intuition  
- ✅ Cover 90% of interview questions systematically  
- ✅ Move from Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced  
- ✅ Prepare for platforms like LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks  

---

# 🧠 Why Pattern-Based Learning?

Instead of solving 500 random problems, this roadmap helps you master:

> 🔥 25+ Core Coding Patterns  
> 🔥 250+ Carefully Curated Interview Questions  

Once you understand a pattern deeply, you can solve multiple variations confidently.
